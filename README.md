# rackspace-ha-dbtools
Tools to manage HA MySQL instances on the Rackspace cloud

Requires the ha-database branch of my fork of pyrax until a pull request is generated and accepted by upstream pyrax. I'll generate the pull request soon.

You can find the HA pyrax branch here: https://github.com/ddaeschler/pyrax/tree/ha-database
